 ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project implements a machine learning approach to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of real transaction records. It explores various classification models to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activity.

After training a logistic regression model for credit card fraud detection, it was evident that class imbalance significantly affected the model's ability to detect fraud. 

Applying SMOTE to oversample the minority class led to a substantial increase in recall and F1-score.

This shows that handling imbalance is essential when dealing with real-world fraud datasets.
The final model provides a more balanced and effective prediction of fraudulent transactions.
